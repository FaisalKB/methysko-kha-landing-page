# Methysko Kha's very own webpage!
### A simple webpage in HTML/CSS made for my character from the popular MMO Final Fantasy XIV

The purpose of this page is to allow players of the MMO to view a little bit about my character in the game as well as my performance. This repository demonstrates the following tools and concepts:


### Mobile-First Approach:
Progressive enhancement (Also known as Mobile-First Approach) involves designing for the smallest screen first, then progressively adding features and rearranging the layout to take advantage of larger screen sizes.

As it turns out, progressive enhancement ensures that there is a good enough user experience on all screens. Designing your pages to work on smaller screens first is the generally accepted approach to making web pages today.

### Media queries:
Media queries are essentially an 'if' statement for CSS. A condition is set, and if that condition is met, then the CSS rules within it will be applied. Typically, media queries are used for changing the CSS of a website based on screen size.

With a simple media query, you can quickly provide a responsive layout to nearly any standard website by changing how the website looks based on if you're viewing on a mobile phone, tablet or computer.
